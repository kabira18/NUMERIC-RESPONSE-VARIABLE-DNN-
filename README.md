Deep Neural Network (DNN) Regression Model using Keras and Boston Housing Dataset in R


Overview


This repository contains R code for building and training a deep neural network (DNN) regression model using the Keras package to predict housing prices in Boston. We utilize the Boston Housing dataset from the mlbench package and leverage additional packages like dplyr and magrittr for data manipulation.


Repository Contents


- boston_housing_dnn.R: R script containing code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
- boston_housing_data.csv: Boston Housing dataset used for training and testing (included for convenience).



Requirements


- R version 4.0 or higher
- Following R packages:
    - keras
    - tensorflow (backend for Keras)
    - dplyr
    - magrittr
    - mlbench (for Boston Housing dataset)
    - ggplot2 (for visualization)
